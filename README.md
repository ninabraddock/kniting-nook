### kniting-nook
This will act as a platform to help users both find patterns and have a place to store their own projects/works in progress.
- under each pattern will be a suggestion of other similar patterns that other users have purchased or are other projects made by the same project designer
- there will also be subpages under each project connecting all the projects made from that pattern including details fo the yarn, needle size, and notes about the pattern that individual had when making it.
- A forum will be added for general questions and answers about the pattern that will be direct communication between maker and pattern designer
- patterns can't be purchased on the site but rather through an external link.
