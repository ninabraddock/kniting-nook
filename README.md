Knitting Nook is an ecommerce website consisting of nine web pages. These pages are structured using Bootstrap, CSS (done in a separate style sheet), 
JavaScript, and HTML (icons from Google icons and Font Awesome, tags for HTML form, tables, lists, formatting, videos, 
images, hyperlinks, header/footer, and buttons) with adequate comments throughout.

Awareness of accessibility issues:
- Semantic HTML elements
- The hover selector adding an underline on the favorite icon for users with low vision
- The previous/next buttons changing their `background-color` and `color` when clicked on to illustrate alternative images of a product
- Alternative text on images and videos
- High-contrast colors (indicated by Inspect Mode in DevTools)
- Adding the `cursor: pointer;` property making it clear to users when an element can be clicked

Consideration for a responsive web design:
- Using Chrome's developer tool panel and checking the layout on every device in the responsive dropdown menu.
- The "Best Sellers" page reconfigures the layout entirely having the product and its alternative images at the top and description at the bottom
  for smaller screen sizes instead of side-by-side
